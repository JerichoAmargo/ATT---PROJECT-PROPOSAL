## Introduction
  Agriculture plays an important role in the Philippine economy by contributing to employment, food security and rural development. However, the industry is facing many challenges such as climate change, population growth and agricultural inefficiency that affect its sustainability and sustainable production. Food security and the promotion of sustainable agriculture are among the priorities of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Philippines, which require urgent attention and action. The aim is to explore and solve these problems by focusing on rural areas where agriculture is the main livelihood and food is not satisfied. 

#### The SDGs that this project aims to attain are Zero Hunger (SDG 2) and Climate Action (SDG 13).

![SDG 2](https://github.com/JerichoAmargo/ATT---PROJECT-PROPOSAL/blob/main/SDG%202.png)
*  **SDG 2 Zero Hunger** aims to end hunger, ensure food security and improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. This goal aims to increase annual access to nutritious food for all, double agricultural and smallholder incomes and implement measures to improve crops and profits, help protect ecosystems and strengthen climate change by gradually improving land. and good soil.
![SDG 13 ](https://github.com/JerichoAmargo/ATT---PROJECT-PROPOSAL/blob/main/SDG%2013.png)
*  **SDG 13 Climate Action** emphasizes the imperative need to combat climate change and its consequences. This objective is especially pertinent for producers who are severely impacted by climate-related risks. Farmers can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and increase their ability to adapt to climate change, extreme weather, drought, and other disasters by instituting sustainable and resilient farming practices.
  
The Philippine archipelago, with its fertile soils and diverse ecosystems, has enormous potential for agricultural productivity. However, rural areas often have high levels of poverty, lack of access to work and small-scale agriculture, which is not easy. These challenges are exacerbated by climate change, with higher temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns and less frequent weather events affecting crop and animal health.   

This project attempts to increase food security in rural Philippines by promoting sustainable agriculture.   This includes implementing and strengthening agricultural practices in the village, developing farmers' skills and abilities, improving trade and services, and promoting the food supply.


## Problem Statement
  Coastal communities face challenging objectives, including both the preservation of biological diversity and the encouragement of sustained economic expansion. Examples of such dangers include things like habitat destruction, excessive fishing, pollution, and climate change. As a result of this, there is a tension between fostering economic growth and protecting natural resources in areas where people base their livelihoods on the extraction of natural resources.

## Significance of the Proposed Project
  This project produces a number of significant results. It will first promote biodiversity conservation by implementing sustainable fishing practices, safeguarding vital habitats, and restoring degraded ecosystems. Secondly, it will promote economic development by creating ecotourism programs that offer employment opportunities and contribute to the local economy. Lastly, it will raise awareness of the significance of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, thereby encouraging community engagement and participation.
  
## Methods
Several distinct stages of the proposed project will be carried out. First, in each area, we'll undertake a biodiversity assessment to find the most important ecosystems and the most at-risk species. Following this, sustainable fishing methods will be put into place, including the use of alternative fishing gear, the closure of fishing sites, and the restriction of fishing to certain times of the year.

In the project's second phase, reforestation and coral transplantation will be among the techniques used to restore degraded habitats, such as mangrove forests and coral reefs. In addition, the project will create ecotourism programs that encourage responsible travel while also providing locals with new employment possibilities.

Community outreach and education will round out the project's goals, highlighting the connection between protecting biodiversity and fostering long-term growth. For this purpose, we will create outreach and education programs and launch neighborhood conservation projects.

## Expected Output: The expected outputs of this project include:
* Implementation of sustainable fishing practices and ecosystem restoration results in improved biodiversity conservation.

* Through the development of ecotourism programs, employment opportunities and economic growth will increase.

*  Enhanced community engagement and participation in conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development heightened awareness of the value of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.
