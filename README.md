# Project Title: Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security in Rural Philippines

#### This repository is for our requirement in BAT404 - Analytics Techniques and Tools (IT 3204)

## Introduction
  Agriculture plays an important role in the Philippine economy by contributing to employment, food security and rural development. However, the industry is facing many challenges such as climate change, population growth and agricultural inefficiency that affect its sustainability and sustainable production. Food security and the promotion of sustainable agriculture are among the priorities of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Philippines, which require urgent attention and action. The aim is to explore and solve these problems by focusing on rural areas where agriculture is the main livelihood and food is not satisfied. 

#### The SDGs that this project aims to attain are Zero Hunger (SDG 2) and Climate Action (SDG 13).

![SDG 2](https://github.com/JerichoAmargo/ATT---PROJECT-PROPOSAL/blob/main/SDG%202.png)
*  **SDG 2 Zero Hunger** aims to end hunger, ensure food security and improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. This goal aims to increase annual access to nutritious food for all, double agricultural and smallholder incomes and implement measures to improve crops and profits, help protect ecosystems and strengthen climate change by gradually improving land. and good soil.

![SDG 13](https://github.com/JerichoAmargo/ATT---PROJECT-PROPOSAL/blob/main/SDG%2013.png)
*  **SDG 13 Climate Action** emphasizes the imperative need to combat climate change and its consequences. This objective is especially pertinent for producers who are severely impacted by climate-related risks. Farmers can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and increase their ability to adapt to climate change, extreme weather, drought, and other disasters by instituting sustainable and resilient farming practices.
  
The Philippine archipelago, with its fertile soils and diverse ecosystems, has enormous potential for agricultural productivity. However, rural areas often have high levels of poverty, lack of access to work and small-scale agriculture, which is not easy. These challenges are exacerbated by climate change, with higher temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns and less frequent weather events affecting crop and animal health.   

This project attempts to increase food security in rural Philippines by promoting sustainable agriculture.   This includes implementing and strengthening agricultural practices in the village, developing farmers' skills and abilities, improving trade and services, and promoting the food supply.


## Problem Statement
 Multiple interconnected problems have a significant impact on the Philippines' agricultural sector. The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and changes to traditional patterns of rainfall that characterize climate change are serious issues. These changes hurt rural farmers more than other people because their lives depend on subsistence farming and they have fewer resources and less ability to change.
 
The rising number of Filipinos has increased the need for food and added stress to the country's already struggling agricultural industry. Slash-and-burn farming and using too many chemical fertilizers and pesticides are two examples of harmful farming methods that threaten the future of farmland in the country.

These conditions increase hunger, particularly in rural places where fresh, healthy food is more difficult to come by. A comprehensive policy is needed to promote sustainable agriculture, enhance rural quality of life, and guarantee food for all.


## Significance of the Proposed Project
  This project aims to help reach Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger) and 15 (Life on Land) by promoting sustainable gardening and improving food security in rural Philippines. The significance of the project extends to various stakeholders:
  
* **Rural Farmers:** To help rural farmers increase their income and decrease their negative impact on the environment, this project will teach them new skills.

* **Local Communities:** The project can help improve nutrition and health in local communities by making sure there is enough food.

* **Government Agencies:** The project can give useful information and suggestions for making policies and running programs that will make agriculture more sustainable and improve food security.

* **Future Researchers:** This project's data and conclusions can be used as a starting point for more study on related topics, adding to what is known in this field.

  
## Methods
The project will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. This will involve:

•	Surveying rural farmers to assess their farming practices, challenges, and needs.

•	Conducting focus group discussions and interviews with farmers, community leaders, and agricultural extension workers to gain deeper insights into the local context and experiences.

•	Reviewing existing literature and policies related to agriculture and food security in the Philippines.

•	Collaborating with local agricultural extension services and NGOs to implement and monitor sustainable farming practices.

•	Analyzing data collected to identify key trends, challenges, and opportunities, and to evaluate the impact of implemented practices.

## Expected Output: The expected outputs of this project include:

  The project's expected output is to provide a comprehensive report on agricultural and food security in rural areas of the Philippines, outlining both present issues and proposed solutions. Sustainable agricultural practices will be implemented and evaluated in specific communities with the goals of improving food security and promoting environmental sustainability.
